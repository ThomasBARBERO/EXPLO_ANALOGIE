python main.py ID_EXP encoder CNN/MLP
With ID_EXP a number
encoder : GloVe-mean, bert-base-mean, roberta-base-mean, bert-base-CLS, roberta-base-CLS, bert-large-mean, roberta-large-mean

RESULTS directory structured as follows:
RESULTS - EXPERIENCE_(ID_EXP) - config.txt
                              - MLP         - MODELS
                              - CNN         - MODELS
                              
config file example is given, only batch sizes, dropout and learning rate parameters are effective
